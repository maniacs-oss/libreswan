 * Build up a diagnostic in a static buffer -- NOT RE-ENTRANT.

 * Although this would be a generally useful function, it is very
 * hard to come up with a discipline that prevents different uses
 * from interfering.  It is intended that by limiting it to building
 * diagnostics, we will avoid this problem.
 * Juggling is performed to allow an argument to be a previous
 * result: the new string may safely depend on the old one.  This
 * restriction is not checked in any way: violators will produce
 * confusing results (without crashing!).
